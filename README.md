# Legion Kernel for Atoll (SM7125) platform

> [!NOTE]
> I'm not the original author of this nor did I make the BPF backports (until July 2026). This kernel's maintainer was [Simon1511](https://github.com/Simon1511) previously, and later [frostg-012](https://github.com/frostg-012) under the name Valeryn, I just added defconfig entries in order to make it compatible with the Tab S6 Lite 2022. Workflows were taken from [the LineageOS KernelSU Next kernel](https://github.com/IamKavy47/gta4xlve_kernel_ksun) by [IamKavy47](https://github.com/IamKavy47)

### About this Repository:
- This kernel was compiled in late May 2026 from the kernel source used in the One UI 8 port for the Galaxy A52 4G (SM-A525F), using a defconfig containing entries for P613 drivers. It has also recently been proven capable of booting OneUI 8 and 8.5.
